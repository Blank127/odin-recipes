    <h1>Hearty Vegetable Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/Lasagna.jpeg">
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>amazing Hawaiian comfort food classic is made by topping rice with a fried burger, which is then smothered with a rich, brown gravy and finished 
        with a fried egg. Seriously, how did it take until 1949 for someone to think of this combination? We all get hangry sometimes, so whether you're a 
        broke student or an older professional who just wishes you were, this cheap, filling bowl of goodness is the perfect solution. Garnish with green 
        onions.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (4 ounce) patties ground beef </li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper </li>
        <li>1Â½ cups beef stock </li>
        <li>4 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce </li>
        <li>2 drops sesame oil, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ketchup </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons white sugar (Optional) </li>
        <li>4 teaspoons cornstarch </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons unsalted butter, divided </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced green onions, white and light green parts only </li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>2 cups hot cooked white rice </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Season patties with salt, pepper, and cayenne.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whisk beef stock, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, sesame oil, ketchup, sugar, and cornstarch together in a bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patty in the hot skillet until a browned crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip; toss in green onions and cook the other side until both beef and onions are browned, 4 to 5 minutes more. Remove patty and most of the green onions to a plate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pour beef stock mixture into the skillet. Stir, scraping up browned bits from the bottom, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and reserve gravy until needed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Melt remaining butter in another skillet over medium heat. Add eggs to the skillet and fry side-by-side until whites are set and yolks are still runny.</p></li>
        <li><p>Divide rice between 2 serving bowls. Place patties over the rice, spoon gravy on top, and add the fried eggs.</p></li>
